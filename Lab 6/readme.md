# Executive Summary
Lab 6 covered the topic internet protocol and internet coding. We learned the difference between TCP/IP, what HTML5, XML, and CSS is, and the parts of a link.
## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
Internet Protocols, or IP, are identifying numbers that allow computers to communicate and transfer information to one another without human interaction. There are two forms of IP currently, IPv4 and IPv6. These are different formats but serve similar purposes.
IPv4: 4 octets seperated by periods and was created first. Example: 192.168.0.1, or 10111000:10101000:0000000:00000001
IPv6: 8 sets of 4 hexadecimal values seperated by colons. Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 -source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, is a nonprofit organization that helps create and enforce a naming system acrossed the internet and it's users. Since 1998, they have helped support a singular method for naming websites.
### TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP is a set standard defines how data that is on the internet is sent and recieved on the internet

## Internet Programming
Tim Berners-Lee
### HTML5 and CSS
HTML5 is a 
### HTML5 and XML
XML is different from HTML5 because XML is designed to save data when HTML5 is designed to display data. This is a major difference, as that means that XML is also much simpilar and is more accessible in different versions of software as it is only data, not an application.
## Components of a URL
### Terms
Scheme: The scheme is the part of URL that browser what type of address it is so it can connect to it correctly. In https://www.google.com/ it is the https.

Domain: The domain of a link is the part of the URL starting with the www. and ends at the .com. In https://www.google.com/, it is www.google.com.

Top Level Domain: The top level domain is the part of the link that specifies what type of website it is. in the case in https://www.google.com/, it is the .com

Default Page: The Default page is the site itself, so if you are searching for a google page, the Default Page is www.com when the rest of the domain would be /searchinfohere.

Parameters: Parameters are pieces of information that a site needs to know to load it properly. These can include gateways, timestamps in videos, and specific pages.

Anchor: Anchors tell your browser to load certain pieces of information, such as images, text, or hyperlinks.
