 # Executive Summary
## Lucid Chart
My experience with Lucid Chart, I found that my experience was positive. Since I am someone who likes to visualize data with charts, I found that I was able to utilize the chart to design my program effectively.
## Introduction to Networking 
### Data Transmission
 Packet: Unit of data.
 Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
 IP Address: Unique identifying number
 DNS: Directory of IP address common names.Â  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
 Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
### Network Hardware
 a.) Benefit of Switch over a Hub: The benefits of a switch over a Hub come with the amount of traffic and the security of the data being transmitted. When information is sent over a Hub, all users recieve that data, even if they are not the intended recipient of the data. this can lead to potential security issues if someone who isn't supposed to have access to the data is connected to the network.
 Switches also are able to reduce the amount of traffic on a network in comparison to a hub. when data is sent over a Hub, every person connected gets the data, causing unneccessary traffic to be sent to computers. With a Switch however, only the intended recipient gets the data, leading to less traffic overall.
 b.) Benefit of Router over Switch and Hub: The benefit of a router is the ability to communicate to other devices that have IP addresses. A switch alone is not able to interpret IP addresses, meaning that it can only send data within its Local Area Network (LAN). Routers however are able to read IP addresses, allowing for further reaching data capabilities.
