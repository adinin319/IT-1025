# Executive Summary
Lab 1 in IT-1025 has shown us how technology in computers has changed over the decades, from vacuum tube computation to modern day processes. There have been multiple scenarios where advances in this technology have been extremely significant, although not noticed often as people dont think about it. Two examples of this are Charles Babbage with his calcuation machine and the people mentioned in "Who invented the Computer" (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1pvc9Zh7Tg&feature=youtu.be)

# Conclusion
I found that I enjoyed this lesson because I understood the topics covered very well do to both having interest in the field as well as prior experience with Github. I had trouble at first remembering how to setup the repository but figured it out with some playing with the program. This will definitly help me with my Cyber Security major.
