# Executive Summary
Lab 3 covered a wide variety of topics, from software interactions with hardware to virtual machines. We learned how Software works with the hardware, what types of software there is, what an ERP is, the difference between virtualization and cloud computing, basic coding, and what opportunities exist in the IT field.
## Information Systems for Business and Beyond: Chapter 3 
### Software
Software is just as important to a computer as the hardware; if the hardware is the body, the software is the conscience. There are many different forms of software however, Three examples being applications, utilities, and operating systems.
#### Applications
Application Software is a type of program that is used to complete a business function on a computer. An example of this could be Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word is used to complete the function of typing a message down and storing it on the computer for a later.

#### Utilities
Utility Software is a type of program that is used to fix or modify computers to better their preformance. An example of this kind of program is Malwarebytes, an anti-virus program. the purpose of this utility is to protect your computer from malicous sofware, known as viruses, and remove them if needed.

#### Operating Systems
Operating System Software is a type of program that manages the requests and inputs from other software and how  applications interact with the hardware. An example of an operating system is Windows 10.

### ERP
An enterprise resource planning system, or ERP, is a software application that has one central database that is implemented and used across an entire organization. This means that any information or data that is entered is stored in that one database. The benefits of an ERP come from the control that the owner of the ERP has over the data. Good practices can be enforced more easily through the usage of ERP.
An example of an ERP is Oracle E-Business Suite. E-Business Suite has many integrated modules, including HR, Financials, Purchasing, Manufactoring, and Sales.

### Virtualization vs. Cloud Computing
Virtualization is the process of creating a software representation of hardware or software applications, including servers, storage, networks, and applications. The purpose for this is to increase efficency amongst machines by allocating resources more efficently.
Virtualization is often mistaken as Cloud Computing, and Vice Versa. Whilst cloud computing keeps the computing environments seperate from physical infrastructure, cloud computing shares resources and software on demand over the internet.

## Virtualization
Virtualization can solve many problems when utilized effectively. Two of the most notable are computing inefficency and lack of hardware. With Virtualization, resources can be allocated based on requirements, instead of hardware limitatings not being used to the fullest. If a task requires twice as much computing power compared to others, hypervisors can allocate more available resources to that task to help it function quicker and more efficently.
## Python
Python is a coding language that is often considered similar to C++ and Java. However despite its similarities, people will often comment on its "pseudo-code nature" what people are referring to is how easy it is to read and how python is object-oriented. This is different from C++ and Java as they are procedure-oriented.
## Careers In Computing
### Career Exploration
When visiting the Bureau of Labor Statistics and looking at job availablility in IT, I was suprised by how much an IT employee can make. when looking at the position of Computer and Information Systems Managers, that position makes over $140,000 a year!
### Certifications
#### CompTIA
CompTIA certification shows that a person who has completed it is able to analyze a network and identify, react to, and prevent threats to the network. These include both hackers and malware attacks.
#### Cisco
Cisco certification is not just one test, it is a series of different exams to show knowledge of how cisco works in different environments, and has different options for certifications.
#### CISSP
CISSP is not just a test, but also a title. These people must have at least 5 years of experience as well as proving they are knowledgeable in the CIS field.
### Certificates
Certificates are an alternate option to getting a major. instead of studying a field, you can study a particular skill and earn a certificate showing you have enough knowledge and experience in a field to work in it.
### Co-ops/Internships
Co-ops and Internships are a way to get experience in a field whilst still in college. Students will apply for these positions like any other job, with the goal of getting paid and gaining experience in a field. these also help down the road when looking for a final job as employers will often hire interns full time if they do good work.

### Industry Association / Student Organizations
Joining the Cybersecurity Club could drastically improve how a student is doing in their classes. If they are having trouble in a specific field, they could recieve help from peers on how to approach and solve that problem.
# Conclusion
There are many different jobs that focus on topics extending even further than what we covered in this lab. clubs, certifications, certificates, and co-ops are just a few opportunities I have currently.
