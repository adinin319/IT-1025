# Executive Summary
## Information Systems for Business and Beyond: Chapter 3 
### Software
Software is just as important to a computer as the hardware; if the hardware is the body, the software is the conscience. There are many different forms of software however, Three examples being applications, utilities, and operating systems.
#### Applications
Application Software is a type of program that is used to complete a function on a computer. An example of this could be Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word is used to complete the function of typing a message down and storing it on the computer for a later.

#### Utilities
Utility Software is a type of program that is used to fix or modify computers to better their preformance. An example of this kind of program is Malwarebytes, an anti-virus program. the purpose of this utility is to protect your computer from malicous sofware, known as viruses, and remove them if needed.

#### Operating Systems
Operating System Software is a type of program that manages the requests and inputs from other software and how it interacts with the hardware. An example of an operating system is Windows 10.

### ERP
An enterprise resource planning system, or ERP, is a software application that has one central database that is implemented and used across an entire organization. This means that any information or data that is entered is stored in that one database. The benefits of an ERP come from the control that the owner of the ERP has over the data. Good practices can be enforced more easily through the usage of ERP.
An example of an ERP is Microsoft Dynamic GP. This product is marketed as an accounting software, and can be used to help with large computations and data inputs.

### Virtualization vs. Cloud Computing
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of something. Several things that are often virtualized are applications, operating systems, networks, servers, and storage. The purpose of virtualization is to allow the user to see the results of decisions "ideally" without real world consequences. One purpose is to install malware on to a virtual machine to see what affect it has on the device. <b/>
The difference between Virtualization and Cloud Computing is that virtualization is the underlying structure behind cloud computing; the same methods were used for both software types in the infancy of cloud computing. The difference is how the data is delivered and stored.
