# Executive Summary
Lab 4 covered topics such as basic coding in python, operating systems and command prompt, and different types of images and graphics. with this lab, we learaned the different terms used by code to describe information, how to see information and make files from command prompt, and what each type of image is used for and how its format affects it quality.
## PythonIDLE
Difference between Shell and Idle is that the shell ones instructions one at a time and they are shown immediately. when the IDLE can be used to prepare a set of functions in a code to allow for inputs and multiple outcomes.
### Code Examples
Variable: A variable is a symbolic name that references to a value or object in code. Commonly, people use 'spam', 'bacon', and 'eggs' as variables in python as a reference to a skit done by the television show Monty Python. (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bW4vEo1F4E)

Ex: 
Var=10

Assignment Function: An Assignment function is a symbolic name that references to a function output. 
Ex:
Funky = (10 * 5)

Function: A function is a group of related functions and sequences to get a desired output.
Ex:
Var=10
Funky = (10 * 5)
VaryFunky = Var * Funky

Three Data Types:
In Python, the three data types are integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. Integers are whole numbers such as 1, 2, 3, etc. while floating number are numbers such as 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0. Meanwhile, complex numbers are for all the rest of types of data that are difficult to represent, such as imaginary numbers.
## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster images are images that are made of tiny pixels that store data. at normal distance, they appear okay. but zoomed in, they loose quality quickly. Vector Graphics, on the other hand keep their quality at any level of zoom in. The reason for this is because the vector graphics use geometry calculations to retain resolution.

Each of these images has its own benefits and usages. Vector graphics are used when there is a large amount of zooming required on a specific details. The advantages of Raster is that they can be zoomed out as much as possible and not lose quality as well as there are more raster images out of it.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Whether an image is a lossless compression or lossy compression matters to a developer because they need to know whether or not the image will keep its quality. Lossless compression will always maintain their resolution and quality, whilst Lossy compressions will reduce quality in order to save size.
### File Formats

#### JPG or JPEG
Joint Photographic Experts Group, or JPEG, are a form of images that support Lossy compression.
#### PNG
Portable Network Graphics, or PNG, are a Raster form of images that support Lossless compression.
#### GIF
Graphics Interchange Format, or GIFS, are a form of images that is lossless and can support both static and animated images.
### File Properties
It took 3 layers to make my logo. However, something unusal with this image is that it opens with a internet tab, not photos or any other image viewing program.
# Conlcusion.
Overall, this lab serves as a very good introduction into how to utilize your computer and data more efficently. The operating system part of the lab served to help us identify where a file is saved, what each image is used for, and how to write basic code.
