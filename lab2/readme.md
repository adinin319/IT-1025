# Executive Summary
Lab 2 covered the different components inside of computers and what each parts role was. we covered the CPU, memory, storage, the motherboard, input devices, and output devices. we discussed how these different parts interact with each other and what affects the speed they interact with one another.<br/>

Lab 2 also covered data representation, including binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. we discussed how to convert from one unit to another and what uses each format.
## Hardware
### ALU and the Control Unit 
### CPU, Input and Output
Input and output functions are important to all computers. keystrokes, mouse clicks, microphones, and even cameras serve as input devices, data being put into a device. output functions are just as important. audio sounds and displays such as your computer screen allow you to observe the data collected and make sure it is correct. the CPU and Memory serve as the connection between the two, storing the data and calculating the information.<br/>

An example is shopping at a grocery store. when at a self check out line, there are multiple different ways to input your purchases. you can use the camera to scan the bar code. use a keypad or touchscreen to enter the product ID, and in the case of produce, put the product on the scale to determine weight. from here. the device takes all that data, stores it in the system to keep for inventory purposes with t he memory, and calculates the cost for the product with the CPU. after the final calculated data is found, it will be either displayed or read out to the customer, depending on the device, where they can validate the price is correct.
### Logic Gates and Circuit
Logic gates are devices, both physical and coded, that are able to be used to help a machine determine what data is needed and what do return as an output in different situations. there are 9 different basic logic functions that can be used to determine different outcomes
